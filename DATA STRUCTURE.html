<h1>What is DSA?<br>
DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.<>br

What is Data Structure?<br>
A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.<br>

What is Algorithm?<br>
Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.<br>

How to start learning DSA?<br>
The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially. The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:<br>

Practice Problems on DSA<br>
1. Learn about Complexities<br>
Here comes one of the interesting and important topics. The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient or not? This is measured by complexities. Complexity is of two types:<br>

Time Complexity:<br> Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
Space Complexity:<br> Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
Both of the above complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters. But here arises a problem. The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as: 

The number of operations performed in the program, 
The speed of the device, and also 
The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform. 
So how can we determine which one is efficient? The answer is the use of asymptotic notation. 

Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. 

It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program. The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms:

Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.

The most used notation in the analysis of a code is the Big O Notation which gives an upper bound of the running time of the code (or the amount of memory used in terms of input size).

2. Learn Data Structures<br>
Here comes the most crucial and the most awaited stage of the roadmap for learning data structure and algorithm – the stage where you start learning about DSA. The topic of DSA consists of two parts: <br>

Data Structures<br>
Algorithms <br>
Though they are two different things, they are highly interrelated, and it is very important to follow the right track to learn them most efficiently. If you are confused about which one to learn first, we recommend you to go through our detailed analysis on the topic: What should I learn first- Data Structures or Algorithms?<br>

Here we have followed the flow of learning a data structure and then the most related and important algorithms used by that data structure.<br>

1. Array<br>
The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number. <br>

Array Data Structure
To learn more about arrays, refer to the article “Introduction to Arrays“.<br>

Here are some topics about array which you must learn:<br>

Reverse Array – Reverse an array means shifting the elements of an array in a reverse manner i.e., the last element becomes the first element, second last element becomes the second element, and so on. 
Rotation of Array – Rotation of array means shifting the elements of an array in a circular manner i.e., in the case of right circular shift the last element becomes the first element, and all other element moves one point to the right. 
Rearranging an array – Rearrangement of array elements suggests the changing of an initial order of elements following some conditions or operations.
Range queries in the array – Often you need to perform operations on a range of elements. These functions are known as range queries.
Multidimensional array – These are arrays having more than one dimension. The most used one is the 2-dimensional array, commonly known as a matrix.

2. String Data Structure<br>
A string is also a type of array. It can be interpreted as an array of characters. But it has some special characteristics like the last character of a string is a null character to denote the end of the string. Also, there are some unique operations, like concatenation which concatenates two strings into one<br>.</h1>
